# Antagonist

This repository contains a simple webpage that embeds the **Antagonist** game created with the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).  The game itself lives on the p5.js site; this project makes it easy to play via GitHub Pages and to share with others.

## About the game

**Antagonist** is a p5.js project created by `JustQ721`.  It includes custom graphics, sounds and gameplay logic.  The original sketch can be viewed and edited on the p5.js web editor at:

- View‑only link: [https://editor.p5js.org/JustQ721/full/7ZuW2I4DA](https://editor.p5js.org/JustQ721/full/7ZuW2I4DA)
- Editable link: [https://editor.p5js.org/JustQ721/sketches/7ZuW2I4DA](https://editor.p5js.org/JustQ721/sketches/7ZuW2I4DA)

## Self‑hosting the sketch

The embedded game is served directly from p5js.org.  If you would like to self‑host the sketch (e.g. to avoid relying on the p5.js domain), you can download your sketch from the p5.js editor (`File → Download`) and replace the contents of this repository with the downloaded files.  After pushing the updated files to GitHub, GitHub Pages will serve the game directly from this repository.

## Running locally

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser.  The game will load in an iframe from the p5.js Web Editor.

## Deploying with GitHub Pages

If you enable GitHub Pages on this repository (via repository settings), the page will be hosted at `https://itsjustQ.github.io/Antagonist/` (assuming the default organisation and branch).  Visitors can then play the game at that URL.
